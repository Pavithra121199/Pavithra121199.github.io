Step 1:Start
Step 2:Decalre the variables
Step 3:Read the variables such as question type,difficulty,total attendees from user
Step 4:Assign actual count=total attendees
Step 5:Read the time taken for the question
Step 6:If (strcmp(question type,"MCQ")==0)
           Read the number of changes in MCQ
           Assign actual count=total count-changes
           Goto step 7
       else if(strcmp(question type,"Programming")==0)
            Read the number of compilations and the programming language used from the user
            Assign actual count=total count-compilations
Step 7:Read the number of hints and number of students who answered it right ,wrong and partially correct and maximum marks alloted
Step 8:if(right>wrong && right>partially correct)
            Print "The difficulty level of the question : Easy"
       else if(wrong>right && wrong>partially correct)
            Print "The difficulty level of the question : Hard"
       else if(partially correct>right && partially correct>wrong)
            Print "The difficulty level of the question : Medium"
Step 9:Assign av=((right*maximum marks)+((partially correct*maximum marks)/2))/actual count;
Step 10:Print av
Step 11:Assign not answered=actual count-(right+wrong+partially correct)
Step 12:Print not answered
Step 13:Assign percent=not answerd/actual count
Step 14:Print percent
Step 15:End
